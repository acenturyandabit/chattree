## I want to contribute!

The project is hosted open source on our github [our github repository](http://github.com/acenturyandabit/chattree).

If you've noticed a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request! 

Alternatively, you can code your own module based on the template file in `modules/template.js`.

## Remaining issues

Sadly we couldn't squash all the bugs that were in the project, though we got pretty far!

The issues that remain include:

- Some sizing issues with new buttons on the sidebar: after more than 3 sidebars the window starts shifting around uncomfortably
- When users login / logout on the same device they may be able to see other users' messages
-
